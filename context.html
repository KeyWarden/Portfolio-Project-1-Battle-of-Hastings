            <h3>The Prelude</h3>
            <p>As one might expect, the Battle of Hastings was fought for the sake of determining who would wear the English crown. On one side, William of Normandy, and on the other, Harold Godwinson. In 1051, the then-King of England, Edward the Confessor, designated William as his heir, and even went so far as to send Harold to Normandy to confirm this promise in 1064, with Harold going so far as to swear to William that, when the time came, he would support William's claim to the throne. However, on his deathbed, King Edward purportedly chose to name Harold as his successor instead, and he was crowned Harold II. William, naturally, was outraged, viewing this as a theft of his rightful throne by Harold, and so he chose to seize the throne by force. Thus, he invaded, and Harold came south to meet him. And so, came the Battle of Hastings, in October of 1066.</p>

            <h3>The Aftermath</h3>
            <p>Unsurprisingly, William did not stop his march into England with his victory at Battle. Instead, he marched on London, where he successfully seized his new crown, marking the end of the rulership of Anglo-Saxon Kings in England. William himself was crowned King of England on Christmas Day of 1066, and would come to be known as William the Conqueror. Within a generation, the Normans would change the newly conquered country on a fundamental level, transforming everything from its systems of governance and law, to language, to even, most memorably, its architecture, and yet more besides. Of particular note is the wave of castle building that came to follow, further securing the hold on power the Normans had over the land of England. Also of historical note, was that in 1071, King William I would order the construction of Battle Abbey at the site of the battle, as a form of atonement for the carnage of his conquest.</p>
