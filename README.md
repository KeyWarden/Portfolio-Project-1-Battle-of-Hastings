# Hastings

The Hastings website exists to provide a quick and easily accessed record of the Battle of Hastings in 1066, the build-up to the Battle, and the immediate aftermath. It is primarily targeted towards adults and older teens, and is focused on providing a summary of the more commonly prominent facts and opinions, while simultaneously providing easy access to more detailed resources should the user desire such. 

As the most important information to the desired user-base would be information on the Battle itself, that is presented front and centre, underneath a video summarising the before, during, and after of the Battle, allowing a user to immediately access the most likely desired information.

Due to being a secondary interest in the target audience, the greater context around what led to the battle and what came after are placed together in the Context page, still easily found for a user who want it, but not on the Home page due to the reduced interest.

## Features

0. Navigation
    * This represents the header of the website, and is found at the top of every page.
    * The header contains two important sections:
       - The site logo, found on the left on most screens and in the top-center on devices with smaller screens, like phones. Selecting the logo returns the user to the top of the Home page.
       - The navigation menu, found on the right on most screens and in the bottom-center on devices with smaller screens, like phones. The menu elements, Home, Context, and Register, can take the user to the page of the same name. The page the user is on is underlined.
    * The Navigation, as shown below, tells the user clearly both what website they are currently on, as well as how many pages there are to the site, and what they contain, making it easy for the user to navigate to the content they are after.

1. The Home Page
    * The Home page consists of the following elements - The Video, The Timeline, and The List of Sources
        - The video is a general summary of all the information found on the site in a short, easy to digest format that is sufficiently entertaining as to be approachable to a new, less-experienced user. It is found at the very top of the Home page, and as such is the first thing a user will see upon entering the site.
        - The timeline is a more detailed summary of the Battle itself, being the primary focus of the site. It contains all the most commonly relevant facts and thoughts regarding the Battle, and breaks it up inot smaller, more manageable segments. It is followed by the section of the Bayeux Tapestry showing King Harold Godwinson's death at the end of the Battle, also shown below.
        - The list of sources is, as the name implies, a list of sources for all the information found in the site, providing an easy to use resource for a user seeking additional, less commonly sought, details.
    * Therefore, the Home Page clearly lays out the information the majority of users are looking for, as well as providing a clear route to learn further information should they so desire.

2. The Context Page
    * The Context page consists of the following elements - The Prelude and The Aftermath, as well as The List of Sources
        - The prelude is a summary of the immediately relevant context behind why the Battle of Hastings took place at all, as well as the stakes for the leaders on each side.
        - The aftermath is a summary of the immediate consequences of the battle's conclusion, and how the country was drastically altered by its new leadership.
        The list of sources here serves the same purpose as that of the Home page, focusing more on the before and after of the battle, and less on the conflict itself, and the men who lead each side.
    * Nestled between the Prelude and Aftermath segments is an image of the memorial to harold, purportedly left on the very spot he was slain.
    * Therefore, the Context page clearly presents the information a significant number of the target audience are going be interested in besides that found on the Home page, and also provides a clearly labelled route to learn more.

3. The Register Page
    * The Register page simply consists of two elements - The Registration section, and the Contact Us section
        - The registration section is a form the user can fill out i order to request access to a series of regular updates on various historical seminars, both regarding the Battle of Hastings as well as other matter that might interest them, should they so desire. It is clearly laid out, and easy to use.
        - The contact us section is a list of emails, a phone number, and an address the user can use to get in contact with the staff of the site in the event they wish to do so, such as for help, to ask firther questions, and so on. All contact information is listed clearly, and in a logical format.
    * Therefore, the Register page provides an easily read and used resource for users seeking to get direct assistance and new information.

4. The Footer
    * The footer is found constantly at the bottom of the screen, regardless of where the user is on the page.
        - This ensures the resources it provides are constantly available to the user, no matter how far into a page they might be.
    * On the left of the footer is the organisations social links, specifically to its Facebook, Twitter, and Youtube pages, providing immediate and easy access to its avenues for news and updates, as well as bonus materials.
    * On the right is a button that takes the user directly to the list of sources on that page (it sends the user to the sources on the Home page when selected while on the Register page), allowing the user to immediately access those sources should they want to while elsewhere on the page without needing to manually scroll down to them.
    * Therefore, the footer provides both easy access to additional media venues for the organisation that owns the website, but also a way to easily and efficiently access the Sources of the information on the site from anywhere and at any time.

* The page has been tested on both Chrome and Edge browsers.
* I have confirmed that the project is fully responsive, looks good, and functions on multiple screen sizes vie the devtools.
* I have confirmed the various navigation tools, found throughout the site, are fully functional, and are all easy to read and understand
* I have confirmed the registration form seems to work, and have not identified any issues with it.

### Bugs

* I found multiple bugs while testing this project, however most were relatively minor cases of typos and such matters, and were easily fixed.
* I did encounter problems trying to implement a Carousel into the project, which eventually led to me replacing ti for an embedded video, as I simply did noy have the time to spare on it any longer.
